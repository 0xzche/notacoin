    "Bitcoin uses ECC([Elliptic curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)) to secure the transactions, which is a kind of [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). Compared to the more widely used RSA, ECC has shorter keys and is faster than RSA when generating keys; however it appearred later than RSA and many ECC algorithms are protected by patents, therefore not as popular as RSA.\n",

The keys are used to transform data - for example represent your data as a number, then calculate new data = old data * pulbic key. Let's say the keys do the following operations\n",

    "1. Encrypting & decrypting data: When A has the public key and some data, B has the private key. A wants to send the data to B, so A transform the data with public key and send F(data) to B. Then, B recovers the data by doing G(F(data)). Anybody that has F(data) and public key cannot recover because they don't have the public key and it's computationally hard to figure out the public key. \n",
    "2. Signature: When B has private key and want to request a transaction (for example send money to C), then he could send out G(transaction request). Other people can recover the transaction request by doing F(G(transaction request)), while knowing that the sender must be B but not other people, because it's impossible to G(transaction request) without the private key.\n",
